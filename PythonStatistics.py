### Lecture 2. Binomial distribution

#The scipy.stats module contains various functions for statistical 
#calculations and tests. The stats() function of the 
#scipy.stats.binom module can be used to calculate a binomial
# distribution using the values of n and p.

#Syntax : 
#scipy.stats.binom.stats(n, p)
#It returns a tuple containing the mean and variance of the 
# distribution in that order.

#example: Calculating distribution table :

#Define n and p.
#Define a list of values of r from 0 to n.
#Get mean and variance.
#For each r, calculate the pmf and store in a list.

from scipy.stats import binom

# setting the values
# of n and p
n = 10
p = 0.2
# defining the list of r values
r_values = list(range(n + 1))
# obtaining the mean and variance 
mean, var = binom.stats(n, p)

mean
var


#scipy.stats.binom.pmf() function is used to obtain the 
#probability mass function for a certain value of r, n and p. 
#We can obtain the distribution by passing all possible values 
#of r(0 to n).

#Syntax : 
# scipy.stats.binom.pmf(r, n, p)

# list of pmf values
dist = [binom.pmf(r, n, p) for r in r_values ]
# printing the table
print("r\tp(r)")
for i in range(n + 1):
    print(str(r_values[i]) + "\t" + str(dist[i]))
# printing mean and variance
print("mean = "+str(mean))
print("variance = "+str(var))



# example: Plotting the graph using matplotlib.pyplot.bar() 
#function to plot vertical bars.

from scipy.stats import binom
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# setting the values
# of n and p
n = 1000
p = 0.2
# defining list of r values
r_values = list(range(n + 1))
# list of pmf values
dist = [binom.pmf(r, n, p) for r in r_values ]
# plotting the graph 
plt.bar(r_values, dist)
plt.show()














### Lecture 3. Poisson distribution

#How to Generate a Poisson Distribution
#You can use the poisson.rvs(mu, size) function to generate 
#random values from a Poisson distribution with a specific 
#mean value and sample size:

    
from scipy.stats import poisson

#generate random values from Poisson distribution with mean=8 and sample size=20
poisson.rvs(mu=8, size=20)


# How to Calculate Probabilities Using a Poisson Distribution
# You can use the poisson.pmf(k, mu) 
#to calculate probabilities related to the specific count value
#from Poisson distribution.

#Example 1: Probability Equal to Some Value

#A store sells 8 icecreams per day on average. What is the 
#probability that they will sell 10 icecreams on a given day? 

from scipy.stats import poisson

#calculate probability
poisson.pmf(k=10, mu=8)


#You can use the poisson.cdf(k, mu) functions to calculate 
#cumulative probabilities up to a certain discrete value
# the Poisson distribution.

#Example 2: Probability Less than Some Value
#A call center has on average 5 calls coming in per hour. 
# What is the probability that this call center has four or less incoming calls
# during a given hour?

from scipy.stats import poisson

#calculate probability
poisson.cdf(k=4, mu=5)




#Example 3: Probability where occurence Greater than Some Value

#A certain store sells 15 cans of tuna per day on average. 
#What is the probability that this store sells more than 20 
# cans of tuna in a given day?

from scipy.stats import poisson

#calculate probability
1-poisson.cdf(k=20, mu=15)

















### Lecture 4. Normal distribution

#Histogram plotting Normal Distribution

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  
# Mean of the distribution
Mean = 32
 
# satndard deviation of the distribution
Standard_deviation  = 8
  
# size
size = 3200
  
# creating a normal distribution data
values = np.random.normal(Mean, Standard_deviation, size)
  
# plotting histograph
plt.hist(values, 10)
# plotting mean line
plt.axvline(values.mean(), color='k', linestyle='dashed', linewidth=2)
plt.show()




#Example 1 using Normal Distribution
# Suppose student test scores follow Normal probability distribution.
# with mean 81 and standard deviation 18. 
# Calculate the Percentage of Students who have scores less than 60

# Solution: scipy.stats.norm() 

# import required libraries
from scipy.stats import norm
import numpy as np
 
# Given information
mean = 81
std_dev = 18
total_students = 100
score = 60
 
# Calculate z-score for 60
z_score = (score - mean) / std_dev
 
# Calculate the probability of getting a score less than 60
prob = norm.cdf(z_score)
 
# Calculate the percentage of students who got less than 60 marks
percent = prob * 100

# Print the result
print("Percentage of students who got less than 60 marks:", round(percent, 2), "%")




#Example 2: Calculate the Percentage of Students who have scored 
#More than 95

#To get the percentage of people who have scored more than 95. 
#We first find the probability of people who have scored less than 95 
#then we will subtract the probability from 1 to get the percent of 
# people who have scored more than 95. 

# import required libraries
from scipy.stats import norm
import numpy as np
 
# Given information
mean = 81
std_dev = 18
total_students = 100
score = 95
 
# Calculate z-score for 95
z_score = (score - mean) / std_dev
 
# Calculate the probability of getting a more than 95
prob = norm.cdf(z_score)
 
# Calculate the percentage of students who got more than 95 marks
percent = (1-prob) * 100
# Print the result
print("Percentage of students who got more than /95 marks: ", round(percent, 2), " %")



#Python Code for Percentage of Students who have scored More than 
#75 and less than 85

# import required libraries
from scipy.stats import norm
import numpy as np
 
# Given information
mean = 81
std_dev = 18
total_students = 100
min_score = 75
max_score = 85
 
# Calculate z-score for 75
z_min_score = (min_score - mean) / std_dev
# Calculate z-score for 85
z_max_score = (max_score - mean) / std_dev
 
 
# Calculate the probability of getting less than 70
min_prob = norm.cdf(z_min_score)
 
# Calculate the probability of getting  less than 85
max_prob = norm.cdf(z_max_score)
 
percent = (max_prob-min_prob) * 100
 
# Print the result
print("Percentage of students who got marks between 75 and 85 is", round(percent, 2), "%")




#Find the score under which there are about 80% of the students' scores

# import required libraries
from scipy.stats import norm
import numpy as np
 
# Given information
mean = 81
std_dev = 18
total_students = 100
q_score = 0.8

 

#find the z-value with the cumulative probability 50%
#using norm.ppf() ,which is the inverse of norm.cdf()

z_80 = norm.ppf(q_score)


z_80_score = z_80 * std_dev + mean


z_80_score

#Alternative way

z_80_score = norm.ppf(q_score, loc = mean, scale = std_dev )

z_80_score














### Lecture 5. Shapiro-Wilk test for normality

from numpy.random import randn
 
# Create data
test_data = randn(1000)
 
# conduct the  Shapiro-Wilk Test
shapiro(test_data)         

#The result does not reject the normality hypothesis
#as the p-value > 0.05


#Example 2
## import useful library
import numpy as np
from numpy.random import poisson
from numpy.random import seed
from scipy.stats import shapiro
from numpy.random import randn
 
seed(0)
# Create data
